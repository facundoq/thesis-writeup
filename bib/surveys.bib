    abstract = {Gesture is one of the most natural and expressive ways of communications between human and computer in a virtual reality system. We naturally use various gestures to express our own intentions in everyday life. Hand gesture is one of the important methods of non-verbal communication for human beings for its freer in movements and much more expressive than any other body parts. Hand gesture recognition has a number of potential applications in human-computer interaction, machine vision, virtual reality, machine control in industry, and so on. As a gesture is a continuous motion on a sequential time series, the {HMMs} (hidden Markov models) must be a prominent recognition tool. The most important thing in hand gesture recognition is what the input features are that best represent the characteristics of the moving hand {gesture.This} paper presents part of literature review on ongoing research and findings on different technique and approaches in gesture recognition using {HMMs} for vision-based approach.},
